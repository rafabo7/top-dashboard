# Admin Dashboard -- The Odin Project
A demo of an admnin dashboard built for The Odin Project courses. It'll may or may not serve as a primitive portfolio.
It is orignally built using HTML5 and CSS3, encouraging the use of CSS grid as it was one of the main topics of the course

## Goals of this project

- End up with very nice looking, as well as nice structured project.
- Really (not... seriously *really*) understand what the heck I'm doing with CSS.
- Try to make this page responsive using *CSS grid*.
- Learn to write a proper readme file documenting the process.
